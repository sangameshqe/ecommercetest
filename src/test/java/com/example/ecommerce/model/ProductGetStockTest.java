Scenario 1: Retrieve Stock Value for a Newly Created Product

Details:
  TestName: retrieveStockForNewProduct
  Description: This test checks the default stock value for a newly created Product instance, ensuring that it is initialized correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class without setting any stock value.
  Act: Call the getStock() method on the newly created Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned stock value is 0, assuming the default initialization for an int field.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the stock field is correctly initialized to 0 when a Product object is created. It is important to ensure that the default state of the object is as expected to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Stock Value After Setting It

Details:
  TestName: retrieveStockAfterSettingValue
  Description: This test checks if the getStock() method returns the correct stock value after it has been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class and set the stock value to a specific integer using the setStock() method.
  Act: Call the getStock() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned stock value matches the value that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the setStock() method correctly updates the stock field and that getStock() accurately retrieves the updated value. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity within the application.

Scenario 3: Retrieve Stock Value for a Product with Maximum Integer Stock

Details:
  TestName: retrieveStockWithMaxIntegerValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getStock() method when the stock is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class and set the stock value to Integer.MAX_VALUE using the setStock() method.
  Act: Call the getStock() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned stock value is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the application can handle the maximum possible integer value for stock without errors. It is important for ensuring that the application can manage large inventory numbers.

Scenario 4: Retrieve Stock Value for a Product with Negative Stock

Details:
  TestName: retrieveStockWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getStock() method when the stock is set to a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class and set the stock value to a negative integer using the setStock() method.
  Act: Call the getStock() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned stock value matches the negative value that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the application can handle negative stock values, which might be used to represent backorders or errors. It is important to confirm that the application does not crash or behave unexpectedly with such values.

Scenario 5: Retrieve Stock Value for a Product with Zero Stock

Details:
  TestName: retrieveStockWithZeroValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getStock() method when the stock is explicitly set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class and set the stock value to zero using the setStock() method.
  Act: Call the getStock() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned stock value is zero.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the application correctly handles a stock value of zero, which might indicate that a product is out of stock. It is important for inventory management and user notifications.
